{-| Decide what the Cross button should do.

    - Containers (topicId is also a map id): navigate (enter/exit).
    - Monads: move across the nearest boundary (parent ↔ inner).
      If no owning container exists on the parent, fall back to a no-op move,
      so the button still dispatches a predictable message.

    Every branch emits a Log.info for traceability.
